My hobbies include hiking in the mountains, volunteering at a local camp, \r\n  and studying Greek. More information about my volunteer work can be found at <a href=\"wilds.org\">here</a>. I also learn more about Greek\r\n  at <a href=\"http://dailydoseofgreek.com/\">here</a>.\r\n  I also love sharing my faith with anyone who is willing to listen, and sometimes people who don't care to listen. I \r\n  am studying Bible at Bob Jones University so it gives me a great excuse to share the Gospel with people. </p>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n",
