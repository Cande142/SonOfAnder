  <p>My name is Chris Anderson and I have many exciting hobbies. My hobbies include hiking in the mountains, volunteering at a local camp, 
  and studying Greek. More information about my volunteer work can be found at <a href="wilds.org">here</a>. I also learn more about Greek
  at <a href="http://dailydoseofgreek.com/">here</a>.
  I also love sharing my faith with anyone who is willing to listen, and sometimes people who don't care to listen. I 
  am studying Bible at Bob Jones University so it gives me a great excuse to share the Gospel with people. </p>
